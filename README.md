# KNN-Algorithm-IrisDataset

Here we are using 2 algorithms to classify the test set into different target values
1) KNN algorithm
2) Logistic Regression

Also, predicted the accuracy for each of these algorithms. Divided the dataset into training and testing set and used training dataset to train the model which predicts the values for test set.

Also, see that accuracy changes with different sizes of the training sets.
